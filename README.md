# Pokedex APP

This is my first Javascript app of a Pokemon list which I developed in order to learn the basics of Javascript.

The app shows a list of 150 Pokemons which is loaded from an external source _(https://pokeapi.co/)_

When you click on a pokemon a modal window with the details such as: name, height, type and a photo of the Pokemon appears. In order to close the modal, you can click on the **X** on the top right corner, **close** on the bottom right corner, click outside the window or click the escape button.
 
### The following technologies were used to build this app:

* HTML

* CSS

* Javascript

* Jquery

* Bootstrap
